# GroupedPageView

A [SwiftUI Jam](https://www.swiftuijam.com) project

Can display any `Sequence` of `PageGroup`s -- where `PageGroup` provides a `Collection` of pages, which can be any custom type -- in a grouped page view.

Design (of which I only managed to implement a small portion during the jam ðŸ˜…) by [Kimberly Chiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-chiu/) - check her [portfolio](https://www.kimberlychiu.design/) out!
